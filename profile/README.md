## What's this?
The **BA OST Index** (short for <i>**B**lue **A**rchive **O**riginal **S**ound **T**rack Index</i>, sometimes **BOI** as well) is a project created by [sctop](https://github.com/sctop). It was designed to record and index all the relationships between the tracks and the stories, battles, and UIs released in the mobile game [Blue Archive (BA)](https://bluearchive.jp).

The project itself consists of several repositories, in which they form a chain that can be used for different purposes. For instance, you might want to have original unprocessed data, or maybe you'd like to reuse the processed data for your own project.

Sincerely, I hope this project could become a part of the Blue Archive community.

## All the Repositories
The project can be divided into several repositories, including:

- [ost_data](https://github.com/BA-OST-Index/ost_data) The *unprocessed* JSON data.
- [ost_data_parser](https://github.com/BA-OST-Index/ost_data_parser) The Python parser for loading, indexing, linking and exporting all the data as we'd like.
- [ost_data_export](https://github.com/BA-OST-Index/ost_data_export) The JSON data *processed** by the data parser.
- [ost_data_site_generator](https://github.com/BA-OST-Index/ost_data_site_generator) The Python scripts for generating static web pages for the BOI site.
- [ost_data_site](https://github.com/BA-OST-Index/ost_data_site) The static files for deploying the BOI site, generated by the site generator.

At the time of writing (July 18th, 2023), some of the repositories are private or not created at all due to the time and effort. It is expected to be completed at the beginning of the August 2023.

## For whom?
TLDR; This project is dedicated to all who might want to take a closer look at the uses of the tracks in game.

If you're a content creator, you might want to know where and when the tracks are being used. In this way you can insert the tracks more appropriately.

If you're just a random player like me who simply loves about the tracks, then you might be interested in more details about the tracks.

If you're a player who want to analyze the stories, you might want to get a better feeling about the atmosphere at certain story plots.

## Why This Project
Blue Archive was my first anime game. I started playing it in the April 2023 and was immediately immersed in its characters and the universe. Indeed, it's a great and unique game, especially in terms of the stories.

A good story is composed of three main elements: the characters, the writing, and the music. Though we already have different tools for exploring characters (e.g. [SchaleDB](https://schale.gg/)) and replaying stories (e.g. [blue-archive.io](https://blue-archive.io)), there's not a single website for the music itself.

To my eyes, I think it only makes sense to have a website specifically for the music, as it shouldn't be overlooked. And so I thought to myself, that maybe, I should create a website by myself too.

And so, as a direct result of it, *BA OST Index* was born.
